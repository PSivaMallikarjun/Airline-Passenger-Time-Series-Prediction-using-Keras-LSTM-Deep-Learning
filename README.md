# Airline-Passenger-Time-Series-Prediction-using-Keras-LSTM-Deep-Learning
We will use the Airline Passenger dataset for this project. This dataset provides the monthly total passenger numbers of a US airline from 1949 to 1960. We will produce a solution for this project by using the LSTM model available in Keras, and you will see a good example of how to solve Time Series problems with Deep Learning in general.
